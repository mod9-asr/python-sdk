DESCRIPTION = """
This specialized tool can be used to replicate results from rmtg.co/benchmark by suitably
formatting and scoring output from the Mod9 ASR Engine.
It reads lines of JSON (i.e. JSONL format) from stdin and prints a report on stdout, saving
files in a work directory.
It can also read input formatted as per the Google STT service (i.e. a single JSON object).
This uses the official NIST SCTK software, which is expected to be installed on the system,
and also requires certain reference data files which might be downloaded.
Each of those dependencies is installed in the mod9/asr Docker image for convenience.
The Switchboard audio data is needed for meaningful demonstration and could
be obtained from the Linguistic Data Consortium (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S09).

    Convert ASR Engine output (JSON lines) to a NIST-formatted CTM file.

    The keys are used to lookup the corresponding reference in the STM file.
    The first key is traditionally the basename of a 2-channel audio file.
    The second key is traditionally a channel identifier, e.g. "A" or "B".

    If the alternatives argument is specified (as "phrase", "transcript", or
    "word"), the resulting file will make use of the CTM format's ability to
    represent alternative hypotheses. This somewhat lesser-known feature of
    the NIST SCTK software is unfortunately a bit buggy, though, and will
    require further post-processing to be handled correctly after filtering
    with the csrfilt.sh tool.

    The list of exclude_words is used as a simple filter to remove words in
    ASR output that is not well matched to the reference conventions. For
    example, it is never helpful to transcribe non-speech noises, since the
    reference does not include these and they will become insertion errors.

    The split_initialisms argument is used to match a convention in the
    reference transcription: for example, Y M C A should be 4 single-letter
    words rather than one single word such as y._m._c._a.
